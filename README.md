# DataScience__MachineLearning
This is the main Repo for the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning course in the University of Lausanne.
I will also add some exercises from the Master in Computer Science of the BeNeFri programm.

By the end of the semester I achieved a grade of 5/6. This course has equipped me with a solid foundation in various aspects of machine learning and data analysis.

## Course Highlights
During the course, I delved into both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, exploring a wide range of methodologies and algorithms. Some of the key topics covered include:

### Supervised Learning

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning

K-means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

### Additional Topics
Beyond supervised and unsupervised learning, the course also touched upon various other essential concepts in data science and machine learning, such as:

Model Evaluation and Validation
Dimensionality Reduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Practical Experience

Throughout the course, I gained practical experience by working on hands-on projects and assignments, applying the learned concepts to real-world datasets. This practical exposure enhanced my understanding of data science workflows and the challenges associated with real-world data analysis tasks.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Feel free to explore my projects, and I hope they showcase my proficiency in data science and machine learning concepts!
